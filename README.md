# [Kando - The Benefits App](https://kando.govt.hu/)

Our Congressional App Challenge Submission for the 2025 competition:

We’ve noticed that in the past 3 years, the cost of living within our city has sky-rocketed. About 6 months ago, a friend of ours had an uncle living paycheck to paycheck who nearly became homeless because he was being evicted from his apartment. We know that, unfortunately, this story is not unique, and millions of Americans around the country are suffering a similar fate. Coinciding with Sharice Davids’s mission to make day-to-day life easier within our district, we decided to use computer science to develop an app to help people seek out benefits without having to scour the internet for obscure links and information.

KanDo allows users to identify what benefits they qualify for using a user-friendly, intuitive questionnaire. After creating an account, users go to the “Survey” tab and fill out a questionnaire that helps users identify which benefits they qualify for. KanDo identifies which benefits the user qualifies for using the information they input in the survey. Users can also get more information on the 100+ benefits KanDo supports on the home screen, where they can see a brief description and visit the link. In addition, KanDo leverages Artificial Intelligence to automatically connect user data to a personal assistant to personally enable users to understand what benefits they qualify for, the significance of the questions they answered, and how to fill out government program forms. In general, we tried to make the process of acquiring information about obscure government programs as simple as possible for the average user with as much interactive feedback as possible.
